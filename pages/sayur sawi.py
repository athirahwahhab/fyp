December 2023, the price went up and down slightly but stayed mostly maintained between 
RM4.50 and RM5.50. This suggests the market was balancing out after the big drop earlier. In 
January 2024, the prices started to fall, reaching their lowest point of about RM4.00 by March 
2024. This decrease shows that demand was getting weak or there was too much supply during 
this time. In May 2024, there was a big jump in prices, going over RM8.00. this was the highest 71 
price seen during the time we looked at. The quick rise might have been because of the time of 
year, less stuff being available, or more people wanting it. After hitting the highest point in 
May, prices fell quickly and went back to about RM5.00 by July 2024. This shows that the 
market was adjusting or going back to normal after the big increase.

supply and demand were balanced. In January and February 2024, the prices kept going down, 
hitting the lowest point of RM4.00 in March 2024, this drop might be because there was too 
much supply or less demand during those months. In April 2024 there was a big jump in prices, 
reaching their highest point at about RM7.50 in May 2024. This sudden rise probably happened 
because of major market problems, like high demand during certain time. After that, prices are
